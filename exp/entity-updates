When adding a new target type, here is the list of generic systems that should be updated:

- Reviews
- Votes (votes.GetEntityInfo etc. VrCheck etc should just work after that)
- Vanity
- Webhook (create a new driver. Add as Target to WebhookTarget. Ensure target_type auth is set in webhook APIs)
- User Reminders [be sure to delete user reminders in a delete api if needed]
