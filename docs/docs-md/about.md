## API Intro

Infinity uses a REST(ish) API for most of its functionality. This API is used by our website and our bots to interact with the database.

## Authorization

To access our API you need to authorize yourself or in this case your bot, this can be done by using your Infinity API Token which can be found in the `Owner Section` of your bots page.

Authentication is performed with the `authorization` HTTP header:

```
Header: your-token-here with prefix
```
